### Hi and thanks for visiting my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

In 2023, I graduated with a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science from Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf. At the moment, I work as a Scientific Software Developer at the Institute of IT Security in LÃ¼beck. I am developing software solutions for the [Anomed](https://anomed.de/) consortium.

*My Repository is currently under construction. I am trying to upload more contents.*

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on renovating this GitHub Repository
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning Spectral Graph Theory, Topological Data Analysis, Machine Learning in Productions, Generative Models 
- ðŸ’¬  Ask me about Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Information Theory, Machine Learning and (Representation) Deep Learnning, Causal Interferences
- ðŸ“«  How to reach me: lethanhnam1203@gmail.com
- âš¡  Fun fact: I was "rescued" and now part of ReDI School of Digtal Integration, whose mission is to use Tech to squash socio-economic barriers.
- I summarise and present what I have found the most useful lessons during my AI & Data Science journey in this Repository. I hope that my sharings will be useful for you. Feel free to let me know your comments.
