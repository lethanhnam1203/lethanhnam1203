### Hi and thanks so much for visiting my GitHub RepositoryðŸ‘‹

My Repository is currently under construction. I am trying to upload more contents.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on renovating this GitHub Repository
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spectral Graph Theory, Topological Data Analysis, Machine Learning in Productions, Generative Models 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Information Theory, Machine Learning and (Representation) Deep Learnning, Causal Interferences
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: lethanhnam1203@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was "rescued" and now a part of ReDI School of Digtal Integration, whose mission is to use Tech to squash socio-economic barriers.
- I summarise and present what I have found the most useful lessons during my AI & Data Science journey in this Repository. I hope that my sharings will be useful for you.
