### Hi and thanks so much for visiting my GitHub Repository👋

My Repository is currently under construction. I am trying to upload more contents.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on renovating my GitHub Repository
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spectral Graph Theory, Topological Data Analysis, Machine Learning in Productions, Generative Models 
- 💬 Ask me about Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Information Theory, Machine Learning and (Representation) Deep Learnning, Causal Interferences
- 📫 How to reach me: lethanhnam1203@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I want to spread the knowledge of AI to others, esp. those from disadvatanged backgroundss. I was "rescued" and now a part of ReDI School of Digtal Integration, whose mission is to use Tech to squash socio-economic barriers.
